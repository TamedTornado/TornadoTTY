# Zentty Linux port dogfood field report

Date: 2026-08-01

Status: **in progress**. This is a contemporaneous field report. Entries record
what was observed while extracting Ghostty's GTK surface, the consequence for
the Linux port, the repair, and the evidence available at the time. A patch is
not called successful until focused tests and the live Linux host demonstrate
the intended behavior.

## Scope and topology

The project is building a Linux Zentty application around Ghostty's existing
GTK/OpenGL terminal surface rather than reimplementing terminal emulation or
rendering.

- Product fork: `TamedTornado/zentty`, branch `linux/port`
- Engine fork: `TamedTornado/ghostty`, branch `zentty/gtk-embed`
- Zentty baseline: `dedene/zentty` at `6e021b0`
- Ghostty baseline: `dedene/ghostty` at `4e9fe4bb5`
- Official Ghostty base recorded by Zentty: `19e20f766`
- Required Zig version: `0.15.2`
- Development host: Ubuntu 24.04, native Wayland session
- Alternate display backend target: X11 through GDK/Xwayland

The upstream Ghostty application and the downstream embedding host are separate
claims. An unchanged Ghostty build establishes the baseline. The alternate host
must independently prove surface creation, PTY operation, input, resizing,
multiple surfaces, focus, and teardown.

## Acceptance and evidence standard

This port uses integration qualification as its primary credibility gate. Each
milestone must publish reproducible commands and concise result receipts for
the upstream Ghostty regression suite, a real alternate GTK host, Wayland and
X11, multi-surface lifecycle and stress behavior, and applicable live desktop,
IME, scaling, clipboard, and GPU checks. Later Zentty milestones must exercise
the packaged application end to end.

An environment that was not run is a documented gap, not a pass. Screenshots
may supplement evidence but cannot replace semantic assertions, process state,
test receipts, leak checks, or observed live behavior.

## Qualification baseline

Baseline qualification is complete for the unchanged Ghostty application.

- The public Zentty and Ghostty forks exist and are locally configured with
  their source remotes.
- Zentty pins Ghostty revision `4e9fe4bb5` on `zentty/smooth-scroll`.
- Static inspection found `GhosttySurface` implemented as an `Adw.Bin` with a
  `GtkGLArea` and a full GTK terminal interaction stack.
- Static inspection found 18 direct `Application.default()` dependencies in
  `src/apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` plus a direct `GhosttyWindow` ancestor
  dependency.
- The development host did not initially provide Zig, GTK4 development
  metadata, or libadwaita development metadata. The baseline was built with
  checksum-verified Zig 0.15.2, Blueprint Compiler 0.16.0 at tag commit
  `04ef0944`, GTK 4.14.5, and libadwaita 1.5.0.
- Unchanged debug build passed:
  `zig build -Doptimize=Debug -Dcpu=baseline -fno-sys=gtk4-layer-shell`.
  `ghostty +version` reported GTK runtime 4.14.5, libadwaita runtime 1.5.0,
  OpenGL, X11, and Wayland support.
- The full unchanged regression command passed:
  `zig build test -Doptimize=Debug -Dcpu=baseline -fno-sys=gtk4-layer-shell`.
  The warning output was produced by intentional negative-path tests; the
  command exited zero.
- A native Wayland smoke test created and realized the GTK surface, created an
  OpenGL 4.6 EGL context, started a real PTY child, observed its zero exit after
  2002 ms, unrealized the surface, and exited zero.
- An X11/Xwayland smoke test exercised the same path with
  `GDK_BACKEND=x11`; it selected the X11 protocol, realized OpenGL 4.6,
  observed the PTY child's zero exit after 1999 ms, unrealized, and exited
  zero.

## Incidents and repairs

### Baseline display access was unavailable inside the filesystem sandbox

- **Observation:** The first Wayland smoke command exited 1 with
  `Gtk: Failed to open display`.
- **Consequence:** No compositor claim could be made from the sandboxed run.
- **Diagnosis:** The managed command sandbox could not access the user's
  compositor socket. The Ghostty binary had already built successfully.
- **Repair:** Re-ran the identical executable and backend selection with
  explicit permission to access the live graphical session.
- **Evidence:** Both the Wayland and X11/Xwayland runs then selected their
  requested protocol, realized the OpenGL surface, ran and reaped a real PTY
  child, unrealized the surface, and exited zero.
- **Outcome:** Harness/environment issue resolved; no Ghostty source change.

## Current next gate

Build the minimal non-Ghostty GTK host and let it fail against the current
surface implementation. That failure will define the first narrow extraction
patch; Zentty application code remains out of scope at this gate.

The first architectural experiment will use a minimal Zig/GTK host. Its purpose
is to determine the smallest explicit runtime context that can replace the
surface's process-global `GhosttyApplication` assumptions. It is not initially
a public ABI and is not initially intended for upstream submission.

## AI disclosure

Initial repository analysis, implementation assistance, and this report were
prepared with OpenAI Codex under Jason Maskell's direction. Any proposed
upstream Ghostty communication or contribution must be reviewed, understood,
edited, and submitted by the human contributor in accordance with Ghostty's
contribution policy.
